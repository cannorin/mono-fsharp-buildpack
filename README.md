# Heroku Build Pack for F# + Suave

This build pack is for implementing a Heroku website written in F# .fsx/.sln with NuGet/Paket, using the [Suave](http://suave.io) web server framework.

See  [Suave](http://suave.io) for more details on how to use this.

# .sln Configuration

This will do ```xbuild /p:Configuration=Release```, so your .sln must have ```Release``` configuration.
